<h1>Preparation for the AZ-300 Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies</h1>
<p>
Microsoft implemented a new testing approach in their certification exams. It's called <b>Performance-based Testing</b>  and it has 7-9 tasks that need to be performed in a sequential order. it counts as one single question.<p>
<p>
A good approach to take while preparing for the exam is get some hands-on experience, <a><i>microsoft.com/learn</i></a> and <a><i>microsoft.com/handsonlabs</i></a> has some good resources that can be used in preparation for the exam with different labs that can be used.
</p>
<p>Additionally, <a><i>azurecitadel.com/</i></a> contains multiple labs for different categories of Azure that are free of use, with a step-by-step cases on how to perform tasks.</p>
